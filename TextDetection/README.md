# Vision Framework Demo on Text Detection

Among many of the powerful frameworks Apple released at this yearâ€™s WWDC, the Vision framework was one of them. With the Vision framework, you can easily implement computer vision techniques into your apps with no higher knowledge at all! With Vision, you can have your app perform a number of powerful tasks such as identifying faces and faical features (ex: smile, frown, left eyebrow, etc.), barcode detection, classifying scenes in images, object detection and tracking, and horizon detection.

In this demo app, we show you how to work the Vision framework in Swift. For the full tutorial, please refer to the link below:
